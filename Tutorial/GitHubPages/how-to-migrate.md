1. Create contents of your Website in the "docs" folder. index.md, etc.  
Note: GitHub Pages has folder size limit of 1GB. [Guidelines for using GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#guidelines-for-using-github-pages) 
   ```GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1GB.```  
  It is recommended to place text-only files in the "docs" folder, and large size files like images should be placed in other folders. 
Note: It is easy and useful to use Emoji instead of an image file.[Emoji](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html)ã€‚ In **```Code```** , if the text code is ```U+1F600```, then you can display by writing ```&#x1F600;```.  
Note: Photos are not allowed to store in GitHub. 
1. An example of repository structure:  
   ```
   OpenChain-JWG +- docs-------+- index.md  
                 |             +- meetings   
                 |             +- subgroups   
                 |             +- outcomes
